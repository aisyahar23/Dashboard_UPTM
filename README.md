## 📁 Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the project to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aisyahar23/Dashboard_UPTM.git
cd Dashboard_UPTM
````

---

## 🐍 Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

To avoid conflicts with your global Python packages, it's a good idea to use a virtual environment:

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 📦 Install the Required Dependencies

Install all the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you're in the project root directory when you run this.

---

## ▶️ Run the Application

You have two ways to run the app:

### ✅ Option 1: Run from Terminal

```bash
python app.py
```

If you're using macOS or Linux and `python` points to Python 2, you may need to run:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

### ✅ Option 2: Run from Your Code Editor

* Open `app.py` in your code editor (e.g., **VS Code**, **Thonny**, **PyCharm**).
* Click the **green "Run" arrow icon** near the top of the editor window.
* The program will start running in the integrated terminal or output panel.

Let me know if:
- You want to fill in the actual tech stack (`streamlit`, `plotly`, etc.)
- You want to include a screenshot
- The app runs in the browser (e.g., Streamlit or Flask), so we can add `localhost` instructions.

I can customize the README further!
